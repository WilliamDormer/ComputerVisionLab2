The loss plots are handled by tensorboardX for my project, hence the reason they are not in the file tree
to access them run:
tensorboard --logdir=”src/logs/”

also note that the outputs directory holds the outputs from the test script, but it overwrites results, and not all of them are from the same model version.
See the ones that I have saved in the report for the most accurate examples.

In my file structure, the images were at ./images
and then content and style were below that in their own respective directories.
