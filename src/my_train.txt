python train.py --content_dir ../images/content/COCO10k --style_dir ../images/style/WIKIART10k --epochs 40 --gamma 0.6 --experiment_name "TAExperiment"

# differences from the provided version:
-p is not used, because the loss plots are sent to tensorboardx, not to an image file.
-s is not used, instead experiment_name provides the unique part of the filename, and labels it within tensorboardx. and --save_dir tells which directory the decoders are saved in.

There exist other parameters that can be modified for the script, see the argument list in train.py
However, most of these have sensible defaults.
